                    <p>I was very pleased with the service that I received from our travel company. Our 12 day trip to
                        Belize had to be cut short because of fears and closures as a result of Covid 19 but we were
                        able to enjoy 9 wonderful days in this beautiful country. The resorts that our travel planner
                        chose for our stay were all wonderful! </p>
